## How to Use

- View the raw code version of any page template; copy the HTML code to a text editor.

- Add your own content and replace the placeholder text. Hint: search for the word "REPLACE" to easily find locations.

- Copy the edited HTML code and paste into your Canvas page (in code mode, not rich-text mode).
